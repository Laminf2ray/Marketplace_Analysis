### Analysis of the Shift Toward Online Sales:
Using the described SQL techniques, we calculated and displayed data that supports the trend towards online sales. Our findings are summarized below:

1. **Reseller Sales Revenue vs. Online Sales Revenue**  
   - **Insight**: Reseller sales generate higher total revenue compared to online sales.  
   - **Implication**: This suggests that resellers likely deal with higher-value transactions, potentially driven by bulk purchases or long-term contracts.

2. **Profit Comparison: Online Sales vs. Reseller Sales**  
   - **Insight**: Despite lower revenue, online sales yield higher profit margins compared to reseller sales.  
   - **Implication**: This indicates that online sales are more cost-efficient, with reduced overheads or higher markup potential.

3. **Transaction Volume: Online Sales vs. Reseller Sales**  
   - **Insight**: Online sales have a significantly higher volume of transactions compared to reseller sales.  
   - **Implication**: The convenience and accessibility of online platforms attract a larger number of customers, reflecting the growing preference for digital channels.

These findings underscore the importance of optimizing strategies for online sales while balancing the strengths of reseller channels. Each channel has distinct advantages, and a hybrid approach could leverage the strengths of both to maximize growth and profitability.
